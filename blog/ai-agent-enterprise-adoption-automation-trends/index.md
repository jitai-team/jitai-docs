## Key Takeaways

*   **AI agents** are reshaping enterprise workflows but remain far from full automation.
    
*   Customization, compliance, and embedded engineers are critical for success.
    
*   Overhyped pilots are giving way to practical, human-supervised deployments.
    
*   Enterprises should treat AI agents as strategic, long-term infrastructure investments.
    
*   The real winners will be organizations that align AI capabilities with business goals—focusing on _adoption_, not just _experimentation_.

## The Reality Check for AI Agents in the Enterprise

In 2025, the enterprise AI boom is meeting its first real slowdown.  
Many companies that once dreamed of replacing entire job functions with **AI agents** are realizing that fully autonomous systems are still years away.

While generative AI chatbots and coding assistants have boosted productivity for individual employees, **AI agents** that can independently perform complex, multi-step business tasks remain unreliable, expensive, and difficult to integrate. Their confident but inaccurate answers—especially in high-risk domains like customer service or cybersecurity—make them risky to deploy at scale.

As a result, enterprises are shifting from "full automation" to **human-AI collaboration**, treating AI agents as a long-term R&D investment rather than a short-term productivity fix.

## Case Studies: Fnac, Kyndryl, and Bosch

**Fnac**, a French retail group, experienced this reality first-hand. When deploying generative AI assistants for customer service, its system confused product serial numbers between different models, frustrating users. Only after months of customization with AI21 Labs engineers did the model become usable.  
Fnac's Chief Digital Officer admitted that benchmark performance looked great, but real-world reliability demanded significant **AI agent fine-tuning and enterprise integration**.

At **Kyndryl**, an IT services company, Microsoft's Security Copilot chatbot produced "confident nonsense" during a six-month pilot. When asked to identify devices with outdated software, it produced entirely incorrect results—after $50,000 of testing. The lesson: trust and accuracy still outweigh speed when enterprises deploy AI in mission-critical environments.

Similarly, **Bosch Power Tools** is testing AI-based customer support powered by SAP. The project is still in pilot because the model sometimes provides misleading answers. "Talking about a fully AI-run call center is simply exaggerated," said Bosch's digital experience lead.

## AI Agents Can Help—but They're Not Fully Autonomous

Across the enterprise landscape, **AI agents** are assisting software engineers, marketers, and support teams—but under human supervision.  
At **Palo Alto Networks**, internal AI assistants help analysts review cybersecurity incidents, but results still require expert verification.  
These examples underscore that **AI automation** is accelerating, but human oversight remains essential for safety and compliance.

## Revenue From Enterprise AI Agents: Hard to Measure

While **AI-native startups** like OpenAI and Anthropic are generating an estimated **$23 billion annually** from AI-powered productivity tools, that revenue mostly comes from licensing and cloud infrastructure usage—not from fully autonomous enterprise AI agents.

Enterprise software vendors show mixed results:

*   **Salesforce**'s _Agentforce_ crossed $100 million in annual revenue.
    
*   **ServiceNow** expects $1 billion by 2026 from AI agent products.
    
*   **SAP** projects "double-digit" AI-driven growth within two years.
    

However, growth rates have slowed compared to the 2023 surge, and several vendors—including Snowflake and Xero—still offer AI features for free while customers experiment and validate ROI.

As ServiceNow's Global COO Paul Fipps put it, "Eighteen months ago, everyone rushed to test generative AI. Now the pendulum is swinging back. Enterprises want to know what AI agents can _reasonably_ automate."

## The Rise of Forward Deployed Engineers: Making AI Agents Work for Enterprises

To close the gap between promise and reality, many providers now send **Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs)** to work directly with enterprise clients.  
These specialists customize and monitor AI agents on-site, ensuring they integrate with internal data, processes, and security requirements.

Venture capitalist **Vinod Khosla** compared this to racing: "Owning a Formula 1 car doesn't make you a racer." His portfolio company _Distyl_ provides embedded AI consultants for large enterprises.  
Similarly, OpenAI, Anthropic, Salesforce, and Snowflake are hiring FDEs to deliver **enterprise-grade AI deployment** services—though this adds cost, it dramatically improves performance and adoption.

## Tangible Benefits in Targeted Use Cases

AI agents are already generating measurable gains in well-defined workflows.  
**Cirque du Soleil**, for example, uses SAP-powered AI agents to draft invoice and order emails.  
What once required two employees now takes one person to review the AI-generated draft—at a total cost lower than one full-time salary.  
According to Cirque's VP Philippe Lalumière, replies are "faster, clearer, and better structured," improving vendor satisfaction even if the tone sometimes feels robotic.

This kind of **workflow-specific automation**—augmented rather than autonomous—is exactly the model JitAI enables for enterprises that need measurable ROI today.

## AI Agents as a Long-Term Enterprise Investment

Despite these wins, major vendors caution that AI agent technology remains in the experimental phase.  
**Microsoft VP Asha Sharma** noted at _The Information_'s WTF conference that enterprises should view AI agents as a form of long-term R&D—expecting real ROI in five to ten years, not quarters.

In short, **AI agents will not replace employees overnight**. They will gradually evolve into embedded copilots that reshape workflows from within.  
Enterprises that invest early in customization, governance, and forward-deployed expertise will capture the most sustainable value.
