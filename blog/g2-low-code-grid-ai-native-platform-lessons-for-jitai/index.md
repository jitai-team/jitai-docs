When G2 – the world’s largest software marketplace – ranks outsystem #1 in its **2026 Grid® Report for Enterprise Low-Code Development Platforms**, it’s more than a marketing badge. It’s a snapshot of what the market values _now_ and a hint of where it’s going _next_.

In this case, the headline is clear: an AI-powered low-code platform has earned the **top spot among 50 vendors**, backed by **nearly 1,500 user reviews**, a **99/100 satisfaction score** and **113 category badges**.

Behind these numbers is a pattern: enterprise low-code only wins at scale when it combines **AI assistance, robust system architecture, agentic capabilities, and a strong ecosystem**.

If you read this as someone building or evaluating an **AI-native development platform** such as [JitAI](https://jit.pro), the real question isn’t “who’s #1 today” – it’s:

> What does this success pattern tell you about how **AI-native low-code** should be designed for the next decade?

## The Signal Behind a #1 G2 Ranking

G2’s Grid is brutally simple: it’s not based on slide decks, but on **user reviews and market presence**. To come out as the top-ranked leader in the Winter 2026 report for enterprise low-code, a platform had to do at least three things well.

First, it had to **consistently deliver value for real teams**. A 99/100 satisfaction score, drawn from almost 1,500 reviews, means hundreds of customers across industries are essentially saying: _“This works for our mission-critical workloads, not just prototypes.”_

Second, it had to prove its **reach and resilience**. The same announcement reminds us this isn’t a niche tool: the platform is trusted by thousands of customers, with a network spanning **tens of millions of end users, over 500 partners, and active customers in more than 70 countries and 20+ industries**.

Third, it had to show that **AI is not just a feature, but a multiplier**. The vendor talks explicitly about “AI-powered low-code,” “AI-assisted development,” and “agentic systems” – and then backs it up with adoption numbers. Its **Agent Workbench** is already associated with **thousands of AI agents in development** and a growing community of certified developers building “agentic applications” on top.

Taken together, this is less a vanity announcement and more a datapoint:

> The enterprise low-code platform that leads the category today  
> is the one that has already become **AI-powered** and **agent-aware**,  
> while still feeling safe and predictable to CIOs.

## Why Enterprise Low-Code Won the First Wave

If you zoom out from a single vendor name, a clear pattern emerges in how enterprise low-code became mainstream.

For the past decade, the core low-code story has been about **speed** and **accessibility**: build apps faster, involve more people, reduce the burden on scarce engineering talent. That’s the baseline. But you don’t get to “#1 in G2” and “trusted by enterprises in 70+ countries” on speed alone.

The platforms that defined the first low-code wave succeeded because they convinced enterprises that **“low-code” does not mean “toy.”** They invested heavily in things you care about when systems move from pilot to backbone:

*   Support for **mission-critical applications**: not just internal admin forms, but customer-facing portals, transactional systems and core operations.
    
*   **Governance, security and scalability** built into the platform: so IT can treat it as part of the architecture, not as an experiment running on the side.
    
*   A **global ecosystem** of partners, integrators and developers: tens or hundreds of thousands of professionals who know the platform well enough to deliver at scale.
    

All of this happened while the **low-code market itself** turned into one of the fastest-growing slices of enterprise software. Depending on the analyst, the global low-code development platform market is:

*   Valued at around **USD 34–37 billion in 2024–2025**, and
    
*   Projected to reach anywhere between **USD 80+ billion by 2034** and **USD 260+ billion by 2032**, with CAGRs roughly between **20% and 30%+**.
    

In other words, low-code has already won its place as a **core pattern** for building enterprise software. G2’s 2026 Grid result simply confirms who is currently best at playing that game.

The more important question for you, as an architect, engineer or product leader, is: **what’s the next game?**

## The Next Game: AI, Agents and System Architecture

The answer is already visible in the same press release.

The platform being recognised today doesn’t just call itself “low-code.” It calls itself an **“AI-powered low-code development platform”** and a **“proven platform for building agentic systems.”** It talks about helping customers “build their agentic future” and cites its **Agent Workbench**, where thousands of AI agents are under construction inside real enterprises.

That maps directly to what you see in the wider industry:

*   Organisations are experimenting with **agentic AI** – not just chatbots, but systems that read data, call tools, orchestrate workflows and collaborate with people.
    
*   Early adopters report real efficiency gains in areas like log analysis, ticket escalation, KPI monitoring and back-office workflows, once agents are given structured access to tools and data.
    

At the same time, your senior leaders are right to be cautious:

*   Nobody wants AI to become a new layer of shadow IT.
    
*   Governance, security, compliance and lifecycle management are non-negotiable.
    
*   As soon as AI can act, you have to consider not just _what it can do_, but _how it can misfire_.
    

That’s why the most successful low-code vendors keep returning to the same triad: **AI + low-code + enterprise-grade governance**.

You can treat this as marketing language, or you can read it as a directional signal:

> The platforms that will matter in the next decade  
> are the ones where you can **host agents safely**,  
> not just drag and drop forms quickly.

When you look at it that way, you can see exactly where an **AI-native platform** like [JitAI](https://jit.pro) fits.

## Your Opportunity with JitAI: Starting AI-Native Instead of Adding AI Later

If the first generation of enterprise low-code had to prove that _visual development can be serious_, the next generation has to prove that _AI-native platforms can be safe, governable and worth betting on_.

This is where your strategy with **JitAI** becomes important.

Instead of bolting AI onto a legacy architecture, you have the option to start from a platform that is **AI-native by design**:

*   You are not retrofitting an LLM into a decade-old stack; you work in a system that assumes agents, copilots and AI-driven orchestration from day one.
    
*   Low-code and full-code are both first-class: you can let teams move fast with visual tools where that makes sense, and still drop into full-code paths where performance or complexity demands it – without breaking the AI model of your system.
    
*   Agents and AI Agents are built around **explicit data models, tools and contracts**. Instead of scraping UIs or improvising shell-style commands, they operate on clearly defined operations that you can govern and audit.
    

When you adopt JitAI, you aren’t just saying “we want another development platform.” You are effectively choosing a different centre of gravity for your architecture:

*   You design **workloads** and **domains** with the assumption that agents will participate.
    
*   You treat **governance** as built-in, not as a late-stage add-on.
    
*   You align your development model with where the market is already heading, rather than trying to pull an older stack into an AI-native world.
    

The G2 2026 Grid shows you what good looks like for the current generation of enterprise low-code. JitAI’s opportunity – and yours – is to take those same non-negotiables (speed, reliability, ecosystem, governance) and apply them to a platform that was built for **agentic AI** from the start.

If you want to feel that difference, you don’t have to treat it as a theoretical discussion. You can [try JitAI](https://jit.pro/download) in a sandbox, point it at a real but contained part of your landscape, and see how an AI-native approach changes the way your team designs, ships and evolves applications.

## Reading the Grid as a Roadmap for Your Own Architecture

It’s easy to look at a #1 Grid ranking like a scoreboard: who’s ahead, who’s behind. But if you’re responsible for architecture, platforms or product delivery, it’s more useful to treat it as a roadmap.

Seen that way, G2’s result is telling you three things very clearly:

*   **Enterprise low-code is no longer experimental.** It has become mainstream and critical enough that satisfaction scores from thousands of users really matter; CIOs now treat these platforms as core infrastructure.
    
*   **AI-powered development is already table stakes.** The platforms at the top of the Grid are explicitly positioning around AI-assisted development and agentic systems, not just drag-and-drop UIs.
    
*   **Governed agentic capabilities are emerging as the real differentiator.** The question is shifting from “Can you use AI in your platform?” to “Can you run agents safely across workflows and systems?”
    

For you, working with or considering [JitAI](https://jit.pro), this is both a challenge and a kind of confirmation:

*   It’s a challenge, because the benchmark for enterprise-grade platforms is now set by vendors with deep ecosystems, long histories and thousands of public reviews.
    
*   It’s a confirmation, because the exact direction those vendors are moving toward – AI assistance, agent awareness, and strong governance – is the direction JitAI is already built around.
    

The Grid, in other words, is not just about who leads today’s low-code race. It’s a reminder that the industry has already started its pivot toward an **AI-native, agentic future**.

The decision sitting in front of you is simple, but strategic:

> Do you want to keep layering AI onto an older stack,  
> or design your next wave of systems with AI and agents at the centre?

If you’re leaning toward the second option, JitAI exists precisely to give you that starting point.
