## Deployment Challenges and Solutions

Bringing agentic AI to your company is hard. Forward Deployed Engineers help you solve these problems. They give hands-on help and make special solutions for you. Let's see what the main problems are and how you can fix them.

### Workflow Integration Barriers

Your company's data and tools are in many places. Customer info is in Salesforce. Product data is in Mixpanel or Amplitude. Support tickets are in Zendesk. Money records are in NetSuite or SAP. Your teams talk on Gmail, Slack, and Teams. These tools do not always work well with new AI agents.

AI workflow agents need to use all these tools. Many old systems do not have APIs or are not easy for AI agents. This makes it tough to connect everything. You may also have AI projects that do not work together. Teams may be split up. Data may not be good. These things slow you down.

Forward Deployed Engineers work with your teams. They learn what you need and make solutions just for you. They help connect new AI with your old systems. Here is what they do:

| **Role of FDEs** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Embedding with Teams | FDEs join your teams to learn your work and problems. |

| Ensuring Integration | FDEs make sure new AI works with your old tools. |

3.  Adversarial Positioning—Some think AI is a threat.
