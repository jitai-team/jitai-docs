# What is AI Native Application Architecture?

AI-native application architecture must address not only how AI modules are designed and integrated, but also how traditional technical modules are perceived, driven, and orchestrated by AI. Attempting to integrate AI capabilities into legacy event-driven architectures is like putting an internal combustion engine on a horse cart—foolish and inefficient. Traditional enterprise applications like ERP, CRM, and OA systems will inevitably be reshaped by new AI-native architectures and development paradigms.

Event-driven programming is the fundamental development paradigm for all current enterprise applications. Whether it's a CPU responding to interrupt signals to invoke driver programs, or a web service executing business logic based on user clicks, these are typical event-driven scenarios. In event-driven systems, the fundamental relationship is between events and responders (functions), with explicit mappings between events and functions that are determined at system development time. System architectures designed under this paradigm don't need to support function self-description, interpretability, or dynamism (hot generation, hot loading). In contrast, systems driven by AI intelligence require system modules to be identified, perceived, and invoked in real-time based on intent. System modules (tool functions) must be self-describing, hot-loadable, and hot-swappable.

Application architecture and development paradigms must innovate at the application engineering level, moving toward a new model centered on and driven by AI intelligence. However, this doesn't mean completely abandoning event-driven approaches. Event-driven patterns for human operations still have value. AI-driven systems need to be compatible with existing event-driven capabilities—this is the prerequisite for human-AI collaboration. JitAi has achieved breakthroughs in this direction, with JAAP (JitAi AI Application Protocol) and the JitAi runtime platform playing crucial roles.

## Unified Module Discovery Mechanism

To enable AI to drive application systems, AI must first understand what modules exist in the system and what each module can do. JAAP, as a structured, interpretive application architecture protocol, defines the construction standards and modular architecture of application systems at a structural level. Application build artifacts automatically include the declarative information required by JAAP. This declarative information is clear, accurate, and structured—naturally suited for AI comprehension without redundancy.

Applications conforming to JAAP have self-describing frontend and backend modules. This self-descriptive nature lays the foundation for AI to perceive and drive full-stack system modules.

## Unified Module Invocation Mechanism

In traditional systems, modules are black boxes. AI cannot understand module characteristics and usage methods, leaving AI capabilities and system functions disconnected. JitAi changes this situation. In JitAi applications, AI modules interpret the declarative information of other system modules and invoke them using unified syntax. AI module developers don't need to adapt invocation methods for each system module individually, dramatically reducing integration complexity.

## Unified Module Hot-Loading Mechanism

The functional boundaries of AI applications are often difficult to plan in advance. Compared to traditional applications, AI applications require more rapid iteration and immediate adjustments. Static dependencies and hard-coded development approaches cannot meet the requirements of AI applications that need to be modified on the fly with quick feedback loops.

The JitAi runtime platform serves as a cross-platform application runtime container, interpreting, loading, and executing applications that conform to JAAP. It enables dynamic loading, dynamic invocation, and runtime hot-swapping of system modules. Modules in JitAi applications are self-loading, with no external coupling during the module loading process. The relationship between the platform and applications can be compared to that of JVM and Java bytecode, or Docker and Dockerfile.

## Standardized System Modeling

The key to making systems easily understandable for both humans and AI lies in standardized system modeling. AI can understand standardized content well, but the comprehension cost depends on the abstraction level of the standards. For example, although programming language syntax is standardized, it carries a higher learning cost because it's fine-grained and microscopic. The more microscopic the content, the higher the comprehension cost; the more macroscopic the content, the lower the comprehension cost. This principle applies equally to AI—the more macroscopic the content, the faster and more accurately AI understands it, and the fewer tokens are consumed.

Complexity cannot be eliminated, only transferred. After years of evolution, enterprise application development has formed numerous universal business function patterns and components. JitAi proposes a three-tier system module structure of Meta/Type/Instance: Meta defines domains and categories, Type encapsulates technical implementations while exposing a controlled number of configuration options, and Instance carries application-layer personalized business configurations.

This structure keeps complexity outside the application layer. The application layer itself has extremely low complexity and is easy to understand. Human developers can quickly complete business application module development using JitAi's visual development tools, and AI can also complete application module development more accurately while consuming minimal tokens.
