# Application Layer Stability Guarantee

JitAi supports industry-standard and advanced stability assurance measures at the application layer.

Application layer updates are characterized by **relatively localized impact, high update frequency, and sensitivity to user experience**. This requires balancing stability with the ability to iterate rapidly.

:::tip 
- 🎯 **Localized Impact**: Updates to single or few applications with controllable risk
- ⚡ **Rapid Iteration**: Supports frequent updates in response to business needs  
- 👤 **User Control**: Users choose when to upgrade, reducing forced upgrade risk
- 🔄 **Independent Deployment**: Updates don't affect other applications, enabling fault isolation

## Progressive validation process {#progressive-validation-process}

### Multiple runtime environments {#multiple-runtime-environments}

Create multiple runtime environments in the JitAi operations platform, adopting a progressive validation workflow: **Test Environment → Beta Environment → Production Environment**.

    B --> C[Test Environment Deployment<br/>v1.1]

### Version management and release strategy {#version-management-and-release-strategy}

| Release Stage | Version Status | Validation Cycle | Pass Criteria | Failure Handling |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **App Repository** | Development completed | Code review | Code standards + functional completeness | Return to development for fixes |
| **Test Environment** | Functional testing | 1-2 days | Functional correctness + basic performance | Return to development stage |
| **Beta Environment** | Pre-production | 3-5 days | Real data compatibility + production performance | Analyze data issues |
| **Production Environment** | Production | Continuous monitoring | Stability metrics + user experience | Canary rollback |

## Canary release mechanism {#canary-release-mechanism}

### Node-level canary release {#node-level-canary-release}

In the JitAi cluster architecture, one JitNode serves as the load balancer, controlling traffic distribution. The runtime environment entry address resolves to this node.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "JitNode Cluster"
        N1[Node 1 - Entry Node<br/>Load Balancing + Traffic Distribution]
        N2[Node 2 - Canary Node<br/>Application v1.1<br/>Traffic Weight: 5%]
        N3[Node 3 - Stable Node<br/>Application v1.0<br/>Traffic Weight: 47.5%]
        N4[Node 4 - Stable Node<br/>Application v1.0<br/>Traffic Weight: 47.5%]
        N5[Node 5 - Standby Node<br/>Application v1.0<br/>Traffic Weight: 0%]
    end
    
    subgraph "Monitoring System"
        M1[Real-time Metrics Monitoring]
        M2[Anomaly Alert System]
    end
    
    N1 --> N2
    N1 --> N3
    N1 --> N4
    N1 -.-> N5
    
    N2 --> M1
    N3 --> M1
    N4 --> M1
    N5 --> M1
    
    M1 --> M2
```

### Controlling canary release process {#controlling-canary-release-process}

#### Assessing stability and availability {#assessing-stability-and-availability}

Canary releases require simultaneous assessment of two dimensions: **stability** and **availability**.

- **Stability**: Technical metrics such as error rates and response times
- **Availability**: Business function uptime and user experience metrics

| Canary Stage | Canary Nodes | Traffic Ratio | Observation Period | Stability Standard | Availability Standard | Exception Handling |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Initial canary** | 1 node | 5% | 2 hours | Error rate &lt; 0.01% | Business availability &gt; 99.9% | Set traffic weight to 0% |
| **Small-scale expansion** | 2 nodes | 20% | 4 hours | Error rate &lt; 0.005% | Business availability &gt; 99.95% | Set traffic weight to 0% |
| **Medium scale** | 50% of nodes | 50% | 8 hours | Error rate &lt; 0.001% | Business availability &gt; 99.98% | Immediate rollback or set traffic to 0% |
| **Full release** | All nodes | 100% | Continuous monitoring | System stable | Business functioning normally | Emergency rollback |

:::tip Traffic zeroing mechanism
When canary nodes exhibit abnormal behavior, **immediately set their traffic weight to 0%** for instant fault isolation:
- 🚨 **Instant Response**: Cut off traffic to abnormal nodes without waiting for rollback deployment
- 🛡️ **User Protection**: Ensures user requests aren't routed to problematic nodes
- 🔄 **Quick Recovery**: Traffic can be rapidly restored once issues are resolved
- 📊 **Data Retention**: Nodes remain running for analysis and debugging
:::

### Operating canary release process {#operating-canary-release-process}

**Standard release workflow:**

1. **Select canary node**: Choose one node as the initial canary
2. **Adjust traffic weight**: Set the node's traffic weight to 5%
3. **Deploy new version**: Deploy the new application version on the canary node
4. **Start monitoring**: Enable comprehensive monitoring and alerting
5. **Dual assessment**: Simultaneously assess stability and availability metrics
6. **Execute decision**: Determine next steps based on assessment results
7. **Gradual expansion**: Progressively increase canary nodes and traffic ratio after stabilization
8. **Complete release**: Upgrade all nodes and restore normal traffic distribution

**Exception handling workflow:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Monitoring Detects Anomaly] --> B{Anomaly Severity}
    B -->|Minor Anomaly| C[Extend Observation Period]
    B -->|Moderate Anomaly| D[Set Traffic Weight to 0%]
    B -->|Severe Anomaly| E[Immediate Rollback]
    
    C --> F[Continuous Monitoring]
    D --> G[Problem Analysis]
    E --> H[Restore Stable Version]
    
    F --> I{Is Problem Resolved}
    G --> I
    H --> J[Summarize Lessons Learned]
    
    I -->|Yes| K[Resume Normal Release Process]
    I -->|No| L[Deep Investigation or Rollback]
    
    K --> M[Continue Canary Expansion]
    L --> N[Re-release After Problem Fix]
```

**Traffic zeroing steps:**

1. **Anomaly detection**: Monitoring system detects stability or availability metric anomalies
2. **Instant isolation**: Set canary node traffic weight to 0% (takes &lt; 10 seconds)
3. **Status confirmation**: Verify user traffic has completely switched to stable nodes
4. **Problem diagnosis**: Analyze and debug issues in the isolated state
5. **Fix verification**: Validate functionality after resolving problems
6. **Traffic recovery**: Gradually restore traffic allocation to the node after verification

### Integrating with OpenTelemetry and APM ecosystem {#integrating-with-opentelemetry-and-apm-ecosystem}

The JitAi Application Runtime Platform supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), the industry-standard framework for observability. OpenTelemetry plays an essential role in technology evolution, ecosystem integration, and industry best practices.
