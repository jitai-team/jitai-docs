# API Exposure Examples for Various Elements

Once you've created API authorization elements and configured authorization information, you can expose various system capabilities—including service functions, data models, large language model functions, AI agents, AI assistants, and approval workflows—to external access. Currently, the system supports API authorization for service functions only.

## API authorization for service functions {#service-function-api-authorization}

API authorization for service functions enables you to expose service functions for external consumption. In the authorization details page, click the `Interface range` tab to configure API authorization for service functions.

Each function within the service can be authorized individually by toggling the `Authorization Status` switch for the corresponding interface, or you can click `Authorize All` in the upper right corner to expose all functions at once.
