# Application Directory and Element Source Code

JitAi application directories are built based on [JAAP (JitAi AI Application Protocol)](../../reference/runtime-platform/JAAP), using standard directory structures to organize element code.

## Application Directory Structure {#application-directory-structure}

Each application corresponds to an independent folder, with the path rule in the runtime environment being `runtime environment directory/organization ID/application ID/application version`, for example `home/environs/JRE_MWcVmUZjEq/wanyun/MyApp/1_0_0`.

```plaintext title="Standard Directory Structure Example"
MyApp/                     # Application root directory
├── app.json               # Application configuration manifest
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependency declarations
│
├── appData/               # Application data storage
├── dist/                  # Compiled build artifacts
├── commons/               # Common code library
│
├── models/            # Data model elements
├── databases/         # Database connection elements
├── caches/           # Cache service elements
└── storages/         # Storage service elements
```

The dist directory stores build artifacts generated by JitNodes packaging the application. Every time developers modify application element code and save it in JitAi development tools, incremental packaging is automatically triggered.

## Element Code Directory Structure {#element-code-directory-structure}

Application directories are composed of element directories, and each element directory also follows [JAAP (JitAi AI Application Protocol)](../../reference/runtime-platform/JAAP) with its own composition rules.

```plaintext title="Standard Element Directory Structure"
element-name/
├── e.json              # Element definition manifest
├── config.json         # Runtime configuration
├── loader.py           # Element loader (non-instance elements)
├── lifecycle.py        # Lifecycle
├── xxx.py              # Element logic implementation
```

## Application Source Code Export and Import {#application-export-import}

JitAi provides flexible application export and import functionality, supporting various formats such as source code package export and WeChat MiniProgram export, facilitating application distribution, backup, and module reuse.

### Export Source Code Zip Package {#export-source-code-zip}

In the application list of the [Node Console](../creating-and-publishing-applications/runtime-environment-management#node-local-default-runtime-environment), click the `More`-`Export Application` button on the application card to download the application source code zip package.

**Source Code Package Features:**
- Contains complete application source code and resource files
- Preserves application directory structure and configuration information
- Supports import and continued development on other nodes
- Facilitates version control and code backup

### Export to WeChat MiniProgram {#export-to-wechat-miniprogram}

The platform supports exporting applications as WeChat MiniPrograms, with application source code embedded into the WeChat MiniProgram project directory, facilitating secondary development and publishing in the WeChat MiniProgram ecosystem.

**WeChat MiniProgram Export Features:**
- Automatically adapts to WeChat MiniProgram directory structure
- Converts JitAi components to MiniProgram-compatible formats
- Preserves business logic and data processing functionality
- Supports MiniProgram-specific lifecycle and APIs

### Import Application Source Code Package {#import-application-source-code}

Click the `Import Application` button in the [Node Console](../creating-and-publishing-applications/runtime-environment-management#node-local-default-runtime-environment) to import application source code zip packages into the node's default runtime environment and continue development on new nodes.
