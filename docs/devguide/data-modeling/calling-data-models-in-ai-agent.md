# Calling Data Models with AI Agents

Data models can be called not only in pages and functions, but also used as tools for AI Agents. By adding data model functions as Agent tools, AI can intelligently execute data creation, reading, updating, and deletion operations, achieving more automated and intelligent data processing.

## Data Models as Agent Tools {#data-models-as-agent-tools}

Applications built on JitAi's interpretive system architecture have self-describing characteristics, where elements in the application can be accurately understood by large language models. Data models and their functions are exactly such self-describing elements that can be directly used as available tools for Agents.

When data model functions are added as Agent tools, AI can:

- Intelligently invoke corresponding data operations based on users' natural language instructions
- Automatically execute complex data querying and processing logic
- Implement associated operations across multiple data models
- Perform data validation and processing based on business rules

For detailed steps on how to add data model functions as Agent tools, please refer to [Agent Call Model Functions](../ai-agent/agent-tools#calling-model-functions).
