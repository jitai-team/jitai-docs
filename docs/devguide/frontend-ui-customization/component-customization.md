# Component Customization

Platform provides two main approaches for component customization to meet different development needs and scenarios.

## Developing Full-code Components {#developing-full-code-components}

For developers who need to create custom UI components within applications, you can refer to the [Full-code UI Components in Pages](../fullcode-ui-components-in-pages/) documentation to develop full-code components. This approach allows you to create highly personalized functional components using React, with complete control over component behavior and interaction.

## Extending Component Type Elements {#extending-component-type-elements}

For developers who need to extend the platform with new component types or page types, you can refer to the [Extension Guide](../../extguide/) documentation to extend new component Type elements and page Type elements. This approach allows you to create reusable component types that can be integrated into the platform's visual development environment.
