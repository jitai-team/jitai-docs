# Download and Installation

As introduced in [Basic Concepts](../basic-concept/), JitAi is a cutting-edge application runtime platform and comprehensive technology ecosystem. To begin developing applications with JitAi, you must first install the JitAi runtime platform.

JitAi offers two installation package versions:

- **Desktop Version**: Designed for developers to build, run, debug, and publish applications on personal workstations, with support for Windows and macOS systems
- **Server Version**: Engineered for deploying application systems on server infrastructure, supporting cluster deployments and serving as both testing and production environments

Following installation, you must create or associate a "Developer Team" with the newly created node to access the application management tools and begin creating or deploying applications on the platform node.
