# Download and Installation

Through the introduction of [Basic Concepts](../basic-concept/), we have learned that JitAi is a brand-new application runtime platform and technology system. To start developing applications with JitAi, you first need to install the JitAi runtime platform.

JitAi provides two editions of installation packages:

- **Desktop Edition**: Suitable for developers to develop, run, debug, and publish applications on personal computers, supporting Windows and Mac systems
- **Server Edition**: Used for deploying application systems on servers, supporting cluster deployment, and can be used as both testing and production environments

After installation, you need to create or associate a "Developer Organization" for the created node, then you can access the application management tools to create or deploy applications on the platform node.
