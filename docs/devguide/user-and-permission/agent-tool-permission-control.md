# Agent Tool Permission Control

Permission management encompasses not only traditional portal and page access control, but also execution permission control for AI Agent tools. Through permission control of Agent tool functions, unauthorized operations can be prevented and system security ensured.

Developers can set user role restrictions and pre-execution confirmation for tool functions in Agents, achieving fine-grained permission management.

## Configure Agent Tool Execution Permissions {#configure-agent-tool-execution-permissions}

For detailed configuration methods of Agent tool permission control, please refer to [Restrict User Roles for Tool Calls](../ai-agent/agent-tools#restricting-user-roles-for-tool-calls) and [Manual Confirmation Before Tool Execution](../ai-agent/agent-tools#manual-confirmation-before-tool-execution).
