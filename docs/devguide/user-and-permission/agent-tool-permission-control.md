# Agent Tool Permission Control

Permission management encompasses not only traditional portal and page access control, but also execution permission control for AI Agent tools. By controlling Agent tool function permissions, you can prevent unauthorized operations and ensure system security.

Developers can configure user role restrictions and pre-execution confirmation requirements for tool functions within Agents, enabling fine-grained permission management.

## Configuring Agent tool execution permissions {#configure-agent-tool-execution-permissions}

For detailed configuration methods on Agent tool permission control, refer to [Restricting user roles for tool calls](../ai-agent/agent-tools#restricting-user-roles-for-tool-calls) and [Manual confirmation before tool execution](../ai-agent/agent-tools#manual-confirmation-before-tool-execution).
