# Open Source

JitAI is the world's first production-grade AI-native application development platform.

We invite developers worldwide to build a trusted open-source ecosystem and co-create the technical framework and development paradigm for production-grade AI applications.

JitAI adheres to the principle of "Community Edition free, Enterprise Edition ensures compliant commercial use," lowering barriers to entry while ensuring the ecosystem develops in a healthy and sustainable manner.
