# Comparison between JitAi and mainstream AI application platforms

## Why Choose JitAi?

> Imagine if AI could not only answer your questions but also operate business systems directly, adjust workflows, and even work with you on frontend pages like a knowledgeable colleague. JitAi is such a platform that transforms AI from a "tool" into a true "intelligent work partner."

Currently, there are numerous AI development platforms in the market, such as Coze, Dify, n8n, etc. These platforms have indeed lowered the threshold for AI application development. However, there is a critical issue: AI applications built on these platforms are often limited to specific scenario solutions and lack deep integration capabilities with existing business systems.

Taking traditional AI applications as an example, although AI assistants have powerful analytical capabilities, they are limited by interface interaction patterns and cannot directly access internal data of business systems. They can only respond based on limited information provided by users, severely constraining their actual value.

JitAi adopts a different technical approach. Through an interpretive system architecture, AI can deeply understand the internal structure and operational logic of business systems. AI not only has business logic understanding capabilities but can also directly operate system functions and achieve human-machine collaborative work on frontend interfaces, truly becoming an intelligent business partner.

Next, we will analyze in depth JitAi's technical implementation principles and its core differences from traditional AI development platforms.

## JitAi's Unique Technical Advantages

### Six Unique Technical Breakthroughs

**1. Making AI Truly Understand Your Business - Interpretive System**

JitAi's **Interpretive System** is an **industry-first** technical breakthrough, an application engineering technology specifically designed for the AI era. Through the innovative JAAP protocol, AI can "see through" the entire business system, directly understanding the structure, functions, and interrelationships of business modules, achieving deep integration with business systems.

The JAAP protocol makes application systems an intelligent environment that can be dynamically perceived, dynamically loaded, real-time orchestrated, and precisely scheduled by AI, bringing traditional application ecosystems into the AI-driven and real-time orchestration era. AI assistants can not only answer business questions but also intelligently adjust business processes based on actual situations, as if having professional business experts providing support. Moreover, JitAi's AI can directly operate frontend pages, not just simple backend API calls, enabling close human-machine collaboration with users on frontend pages - a capability that other platforms don't have.

**2. Application Inheritance Mechanism - Industrial-Grade Reusability**

JitAi's application inheritance mechanism allows module functions to be reused, achieving develop once, use everywhere, avoiding duplicate development. We have 200+ ready-made elements covering various elements for Web development (portals, pages, frontend components, I18N, backend services, data models, databases, approvals, events, tasks, caching, object storage, etc.) and AI development (large models, vector databases, RAG knowledge bases, AI Agents, AI assistants, etc.), all packaged and ready to use out of the box. You can override and replace inherited elements, with real-time compilation taking effect immediately after override.

**3. Matrix Element Architecture - Orchestration-Based Development Framework**

JitAi's matrix element architecture is based on a high-integration orchestration programming framework, making business layer applications primarily entity-orchestrated, reducing complexity and engineering effort by 90%. Through the element self-description protocol (JAAP protocol), each element can automatically describe its own functions and interfaces, allowing AI to understand and use them. Components don't interfere with each other and can be freely combined, supporting flexible composition with high configurability. Developers can also customize new element families, supporting complete custom extensions. This orchestration-based development approach significantly improves development flexibility and greatly reduces development complexity.

**4. Dual-Mode Development - Graphical Orchestration + Code Development**

JitAi supports both graphical orchestration and programming development methods, increasing development iteration speed by 10x, allowing developers to calmly handle the complexity and variability of production-grade AI applications. Drag-and-drop development requires no coding - you can build applications by dragging and dropping, and what's dragged out isn't a DSL that needs a black-box engine to interpret and run, but real code (js/ts/python).

When visual development cannot meet requirements, you can directly proceed with code development. The generated code can run directly without special interpreters, enabling both rapid prototyping and deep customization.

**5. Real-Time Compilation Engine - Edit and See, Immediate Effect**

JitAi's real-time compilation engine allows you to support real-time editing and preview, with changes taking effect immediately without waiting for compilation processes, greatly improving development efficiency. Similar to the instant save and preview functionality of document editing.

**6. Automated Operations - Simplified Deployment and Updates**

JitAi provides complete automated operations tools, greatly simplifying publishing, deployment, and update processes. No need to worry about complex server configuration details - just focus on business logic development, significantly reducing operational costs and technical barriers.

### JitAi's Core Technical Advantages

Traditional AI application development has a problem: AI can only "talk" to your business system through interfaces, like a blind person feeling an elephant, only able to obtain limited information exposed by the system, unable to understand the internal business logic of the system.

JitAi enables AI to "see through" the entire business system and truly understand your business logic. This provides AI with deep insight capabilities, allowing it to see all internal details of the system, transforming from "tool usage" to "intelligent collaboration."

**Core Difference**: Traditional AI platforms mainly provide professional tool functions to solve specific scenario problems; JitAi is a complete development platform supporting full-stack business system development from frontend to backend.

### How Does AI Deeply Understand Business Systems and Collaborate Closely with Humans?

JitAi enables AI to deeply understand business systems and collaborate closely with humans through the following ways:

1. **Close Human-Machine Collaboration**: AI assistants support true human-machine interaction, with AI providing processing results to users, and users guiding AI's subsequent operations based on results, achieving a close collaborative mode of human-machine synergy.

2. **Event-Driven Collaboration**: AI triggers events at key points during operation (such as before task start, after completion, before and after tool calls, task pause, after personnel operations, etc.). Both frontend pages and backend can subscribe to these events and respond accordingly. This enables real-time synchronization and collaborative work between AI and the system.

3. **Intelligent Tool Calling**: Each functional module exposes interfaces through the JAAP protocol, and these interfaces can be perceived by AI and called as tools, including various operations in frontend pages. AI can flexibly call various functional modules for on-demand use.

These methods work together to achieve AI's deep understanding of business systems and close collaboration with humans.

## Summary

### Other Platforms: "Specialized Masters" with Their Own Strengths

Imagine you're renovating a house:
- **Coze** is like a "quick renovation master" who can quickly set up a model room for you, but you still need to handle the details yourself
- **Dify** is like a "high-end renovation master" who can help you with complex custom renovations, but needs professional guidance to achieve maximum effectiveness
- **n8n** is like a "plumber" who specializes in connecting various pipes and circuits, but doesn't design overall layouts

Each is professional, but can only solve part of the problem. You need to find several masters and act as a "contractor" to coordinate them.

### JitAi: A One-Stop "Intelligent Construction Company"

JitAi is like an intelligent construction company with complete qualifications:

**Collaboration Mode**: Not just a development tool, but an intelligent partner that understands business logic. Users and AI collaborate in real-time within the same working environment.
