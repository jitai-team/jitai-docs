## Introduction

jitai platform LLC (“we”, “our”, or “JitAi”) fully understands the importance of privacy and is committed to respecting and protecting your personal data.  
Please carefully read and understand this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) before using JitAi’s software products and services.

This Policy explains how we collect, use, and process your personal information. However, this Policy may not cover every possible data processing scenario. For product- or service-specific data practices, we may supplement this Policy from time to time or include separate notices when collecting data.

“You” refers to all natural persons, legal entities, and informal organizations (including all members using JitAi products) who use, access, download, distribute, install, configure, register, log in, operate, integrate, or otherwise utilize JitAi products or services — not limited only to administrators who purchase, download, or connect to the services.

Please note that when you use JitAi products or services, you may be required to provide your personal information as described in this Policy. In some cases, you may choose not to provide personal information; however, if you do not, we may not be able to offer you certain products or services or respond to your inquiries.

Your continued use of JitAi products or services constitutes your acceptance of this Policy and authorization for us to collect, use, and process your data as described. Your authorization will be deemed as consent for us to access and use your registered user information once you register a JitAi account.

This Policy aims to help you understand:

2. How We Collect and Use Personal Information  
3. How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies

## 1. Scope of Application

1. This Policy applies to all products and services provided through JitAi, including software, platforms, applications, cloud services, SDKs, APIs, official websites, official media accounts, and documentation. It covers both existing and future versions or forms of services provided by jitai platform LLC (collectively referred to as “Services”).

We do not control such Third Parties and their privacy policies are not governed by this Policy. Before submitting any personal information to them, please refer to their own privacy policies.

3. As data protection laws may vary across jurisdictions, unless otherwise agreed, we make no representation that this Policy complies with all laws outside the jurisdictions where JitAi officially operates. If you use JitAi outside such jurisdictions, you do so voluntarily, and we will take reasonable steps to process your data in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws.


## 2. How We Collect and Use Personal Information

Personal information refers to data that can identify an individual either alone or combined with other information. We may collect such information directly from you when you create an account, contact support, or apply to become a verified organization, or indirectly through your interactions with our Services (e.g., via cookies or software usage data).  
We may also obtain information from public or commercial third-party sources, such as APIs we integrate to support our services.

## 3. How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies

### 3.1 Cookies

We use cookies to ensure proper website functionality and enhance user experience.  
Cookies are small text files stored on your computer or mobile device by a web server, containing identifiers and other data.  
Cookies help remember user preferences and session states.  

You may manage or delete cookies at any time. Most browsers allow blocking cookies, but doing so may affect your browsing experience.

### 3.2 Other Local Storage

As JitAi requires Chrome-based browsers, we may use browser storage mechanisms such as SessionStorage, LocalStorage, and IndexDB to store local data.  
This helps maintain login sessions, improve performance, and support faster data rendering.  
Most of this data is non-identifiable and used only for service optimization.

If your device is shared or potentially insecure, we recommend clearing cached data after each session.

### 3.3 Web Beacons and Pixel Tags

We may use web beacons or pixel tags (transparent images embedded in web pages or emails) to track email open rates or link clicks, helping us understand preferences and improve services.  
By using our website, you consent to the use of cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags as described.

### 3.4 Do Not Track Signals

Some web browsers have a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites that you do not want to be tracked. Currently, there is no uniform standard for how DNT signals should be interpreted. **We do not currently respond to DNT signals.** However, you can manage cookies and tracking technologies through your browser settings as described above.

### 3.5 Third-Party Analytics

We may use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to help understand how users interact with our Services. These services may collect information about your use of our Services and other websites. You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on available at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
