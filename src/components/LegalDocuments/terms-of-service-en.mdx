2.  This Agreement is a valid and binding contract between you and us. It stipulates the terms and conditions you must comply with when you download, copy, distribute, install, configure, register, log in, operate, access, inherit, or integrate (collectively, “use”) the Service. Your use of the Service indicates that you confirm you have full civil rights capacity and civil conduct capacity to perform this Agreement, that you have read it carefully, fully understood it, and accept all of its provisions, and that you agree to be bound as a party to it. If you do not agree to this Agreement, you must stop using the Service.

## 1. Definitions

1.  **JitAi Application (“Application”)** refers to any application, program, or system developed and operated based on JitAi’s rules, formats, interface specifications, and architecture. It is a general term and does not refer to a specific application.

5.  **JitAi Developer Organization (“Developer Organization”)** refers to an organization registered via the Service for the purposes of building, developing, deploying, operating, uploading, and managing applications.

Its legal responsibility lies with the designated individual or entity; if none is specified, then with all members jointly.

6.  **Certified Developer Organization** refers to a Developer Organization that has passed JitAi’s certification process and review of its submitted credentials. Certified organizations will have their verified entity names and identity displayed. We may periodically re-verify or require re-certification. If certification information changes, the organization must apply to update it.

7.  **Developer Administrator** refers to a member authorized to manage a Developer Organization within JitAi. Such administrators can manage organization members and permissions. The first person to create a Developer Organization becomes the “Super Administrator,” holding ultimate permissions such as appointing or removing other administrators, managing organization data, transferring ownership, signing agreements, or dissolving the organization.

8.  **Developer** refers to a member of a Developer Organization using JitAi’s tools to build, develop, deploy, and manage applications. Developers may accept or decline invitations to join an organization.

10. **Application Administrator (“App Administrator”)** refers to an authorized member of a User Organization with management rights over its JitAi applications and members.

11. **Application User (“User”)** refers to a member who joins a User Organization and uses its JitAi applications.

12. **Application Account (“App Account”)** refers to the account assigned to an Application User within an organization. Data generated by an App Account belongs to the User Organization.

13. **Developer Account** refers to an account assigned within a Developer Organization for using JitAi’s developer tools and environment. Data belongs to the organization or as agreed with a User Organization.

14. **Organization** refers collectively to any legal entity, government agency, partnership, or informal group registered to use JitAi.

15. **Administrator** is a general term for both Application and Developer administrators when context does not distinguish them.

## 3. Service Content

### 3.1 Scope of Services

1.  This Agreement does not apply to third-party services or applications provided via JitAi (for example, apps uploaded to the JitAi Marketplace).
