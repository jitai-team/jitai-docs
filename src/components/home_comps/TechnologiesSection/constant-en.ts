    'Groundbreaking interpretive application protocol (JAAP) and application runtime platform that makes application systems and their modules become interpretive systems that can be dynamically perceived, dynamically loaded, real-time orchestrated, and precisely scheduled by AI---the perfect working environment for AI agents, bringing traditional applications and ecosystems into the era of AI-driven and real-time orchestration.',
    'High-integration orchestration-based programming framework based on matrix-type meta-architecture, making business-layer applications primarily entity-orchestrated, reducing complexity and workload by 90%. Graphical orchestration and programming development tools and methods increase development iteration speed by 10 times, allowing developers to calmly handle the complexity and variability of AI applications.',
